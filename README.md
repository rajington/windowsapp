## Overview

#### Basics

At it's core, Windows.app is just a program that runs quietly in your menu bar, and loads a config file in your home directory.

You can write your config file in JavaScript (`~/.windowsapp.js`), [CoffeeScript 1.6.2](http://coffeescript.org/) (`~/.windowsapp.coffee`) or any language which compiles down to JavaScript. (See [Using Other Languages](#using-other-languages) below.)

Then, in your config file, `bind()` some global hot keys to your own JavaScript functions which do window-managery type things.

Here are some things you can do with Windows.app's simple API ([actual API docs are below](#api)):

- find the focused window
- determine window sizes and positions
- move and resize windows
- change focus to another window
- transfer focus to the closest window in a given direction
- run shell scripts
- open apps, links, or files
- listen to global events (window created, app launched/killed, etc)
- and more!

Is the API missing something you need? File an issue and let me know!

For your convenience, [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) 1.4.4 is loaded beforehand.

#### Modular Configs

Feel free to put some `.coffee` or `.js` files in `~/.windowsapp/` and `require()` them from your main config file.

If you want to put your config files all in one dir, you can use `~/.windowsapp/config.*` as your config file instead of `~/.windowsapp.*`. This has the advantage of your config files auto-reloading properly for new languages, plus you can then put the whole directory under version control more easily.

#### Auto-Reload Configs

When you enable this feature via the menu, Windows.app will reload your config file any time `~/.windowsapp.coffee`, `~/.windowsapp.js`, or anything within `~/.windowsapp/` changes.

#### Using Other Languages

Besides JS and CoffeeScript, you can extend Windows.app to load other languages as well, so long as they compile down to JavaScript. There's a pretty big list you can choose from at [altjs.org](http://altjs.org/) and in [this guy's list](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS).

To use another language:

* Create `~/.windowsapp/langs.json` which is a hash in the format `{ 'rb' : '/path/to/ruby-to-js/compiler' }`
* Now you can `require('~/.windowsapp/myfile.rb');` from your main config.
* Plus you can use `~/.windowsapp.rb` as your primary config.

#### Config Caveats

- If both config files exist, the most recently modified one will be chosen. You can override this by using `touch`.
- If reloading your config file fails, your key bindings will be un-bound as a precaution, presuming that your config file is in an unpredictable state. They will be re-bound again next time your config file is successfully loaded. Same with events you're registered to.

## Config Example

Put the following in `~/.windowsapp.coffee`

```coffeescript
# useful for testing
bind "R", ["cmd", "alt", "ctrl"], -> reloadConfig()

# maximize window
bind "M", ["cmd", "alt", "ctrl"], ->
  win = api.focusedWindow()
  win.setFrame win.screen().frameWithoutDockOrMenu()

# push to top half of screen
bind "K", ["cmd", "alt", "ctrl"], ->
  win = api.focusedWindow()
  frame = win.screen().frameWithoutDockOrMenu()
  frame.size.height /= 2
  win.setFrame frame

# push to bottom half of screen
bind "J", ["cmd", "alt", "ctrl"], ->
  win = api.focusedWindow()
  frame = win.screen().frameWithoutDockOrMenu()
  frame.origin.y += frame.size.height / 2
  frame.size.height /= 2
  win.setFrame frame
```

#### More Config Tricks/Examples

The [wiki home page](https://github.com/sdegutis/windowsapp/wiki) has a list of configs from users, and configs that replicate other apps (like SizeUp and Divvy).

## API

### Top Level

```coffeescript
property (API) api

- (void) log(String str)                   # shows up in the log window
- (void) alert(String str[, Float delay])  # shows in a fancy alert; optional delay is seconds

- (void) bind(String key,              # case-insensitive single-character string; see link below
              Array<String> modifiers, # may contain any number of: "cmd", "ctrl", "alt", "shift"
              Function fn)             # javascript fn that takes no args; return val is ignored

- (void) listen(String eventName, Function callback) # see Events section below

- (void) reloadConfig()

- (void) require(String path) # looks at extension to know which language to use
                              # if relative path, looks in `~/.windowsapp/`

- (Hash) shell(String path, Array<String> args[, String stdin]) # returns {"stdout": string,
                                                                #          "stderr": string,
                                                                #          "status": int}

- (void) open(String thing) # can be path or URL

- (void) doAfter(Float sec, Function fn)
```

The function `bind()` uses [this list](https://github.com/sdegutis/windowsapp/blob/master/Windows/SDKeyBindingTranslator.m#L148) of key strings.

### Type: `API`

```coffeescript
- (Settings) settings()

- (Array<Window>) allWindows()
- (Array<Window>) visibleWindows()
- (Window) focusedWindow()

- (Screen) mainScreen()
- (Array<Screen>) allScreens()

- (Array<App>) runningApps()

- (String) clipboardContents()
- (String) selectedText() # doesn't work in webviews sadly (yet?)
```

### Type: `Settings`

```coffeescript
property (Float) alertDisappearDelay # in seconds.
property (Boolean) alertAnimates     # when opening.

- (NSBox) alertBox()
- (NSTextField) alertTextField()
```

### Type: `Window`

```coffeescript
- (CGPoint) topLeft()
- (CGSize) size()
- (CGRect) frame()

- (void) setTopLeft(CGPoint thePoint)
- (void) setSize(CGSize theSize)
- (void) setFrame(CGRect frame)
- (void) maximize()

- (Screen) screen()
- (Array<Window>) otherWindowsOnSameScreen

- (String) title()
- (Boolean) isWindowMinimized()

- (Boolean) isNormalWindow() # you probably wan to avoid resizing/moving ones that aren't

- (App) app()

- (Boolean) focusWindow()
- (void) focusWindowLeft()
- (void) focusWindowRight()
- (void) focusWindowUp()
- (void) focusWindowDown()
```

### Type: `Screen`

```coffeescript
- (CGRect) frameIncludingDockAndMenu()
- (CGRect) frameWithoutDockOrMenu()

- (Screen) nextScreen()
- (Screen) previousScreen()
```

### Type: `App`

```coffeescript
- (Array<Window>) allWindows()
- (Array<Window>) visibleWindows()

- (String) title()
- (Boolean) isHidden()

- (void) kill()
- (void) kill9()
```

### Other Types

The rest of the types here are classes from ObjC, bridged to JS. Here's a few for reference:

```coffeescript
# CGRect
property (CGPoint) origin # top-left
property (CGSize) size

# CGSize
property (Float) width
property (Float) height

# CGPoint
property (Float) x
property (Float) y
```

The rest you'll have to look up for yourself.

### Events

```coffeescript
'window_created', callback args: (win)
'window_minimized', callback args: (win)
'window_unminimized', callback args: (win)
'window_moved', callback args: (win)
'window_resized', callback args: (win)
'app_launched', callback args: (app)
'app_died', callback args: (app)
'app_hidden', callback args: (app)
'app_shown', callback args: (app)
```

## Change log

- 2.3.2
  - Added `doAfter(sec, fn)`
  - Correctly handles choosing from more than 2 options of primary configs
  - Also looks for primary config files via `~/.windowsapp/config.*`
      - This fixes the auto-reload non-cs/js config files bug
  - `require()` can now take a relative path (assumes `~/.windowsapp/` prefix)
- 2.3.1
  - Fixed lots of functions in API to return actual JS types
  - Fixed event callbacks to give you actual JS types
  - Renamed `app.windows()` to `app.allWindows()`
  - Added `app.visibleWindows()`
  - Added `win.isNormalWindow()`
- 2.3
  - Added ability to use [AltJS](http://altjs.org/) etc. languages
  - Added `App` type, moved `isAppHidden` into it, gave it some fun methods
  - Added events
- 2.2.2
  - Navigate REPL history with C-n/C-p (or up/down)
  - Added 'pwd' argument to `shell()`
  - Fixed some bugs in the API (notably `api.visibleWindows` et al. can be enumerated)
  - Made the API almost entirely JS, so it'll work just as you expect
      - Only non-JS types are `Settings`, `CGRect`, `CGSize`, `CGPoint`
- 2.2.1
  - REPL can now take CoffeeScript or JS
  - Re-styled logs in Log Window

## Todo

* Want to help? We need these 3 things:
    1. better CSS styling in [the Log Window](Windows/logwindow.html)
    2. a better app icon (current one is literally a ripoff of [AppGrid's](https://dxezhqhj7t42i.cloudfront.net/image/1e0daca8-3855-4135-a2a1-8569d28e8648))
    3. a better menu bar icon (current one is literally a ripoff of [AppGrid's](http://giantrobotsoftware.com/appgrid/screenshot1-thumb.png))
* Better error handling when passing wrong stuff into API functions
* Add Spaces support
* Give a better error message if your config file *actually turns out to be a directory* (sigh)
* Make `focusWindow[Direction]()` take into account other screens (and maybe Spaces)?
* Add `api.windowUnderMouse()`
* Add `api.screenUnderMouse()`
* Maybe add `mouseMoved` event? If we do, we'll have to coalesce them to a reasonable amount (trigger every 0.5 sec? make it configurable?)
* Convert more stuff in `api.coffee` to JS types before giving them to people (ugh so tedious though)
