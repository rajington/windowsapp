## No really, what is Windows.app?

At it's core, Windows.app is just a program that runs quietly in your menu bar, and evaluates your config file `~/.windowsapp.{coffee,js}` whenever you tell it to. The config file can be either CoffeeScript 1.6.2 or JavaScript, depending on the extension you use.

In this config file, you can access Windows.app's [simple API](#api), which gives you a few powers:

- bind global hot keys to your own functions
- find the focused window
- determine window sizes and positions
- move and resize windows
- change focus to another window
- move focus to the closest window in a given direction
- and more!

## How To Use

Run the app. Then create your config file at `~/.windowsapp.{coffee,js}` and put some code in it. Then reload the config file from the menu. (You may want to bind a hot key to reload the app during testing for convenience.)

You can use either `~/.windowsapp.coffee` or `~/.windowsapp.js`. If both exist, only the CoffeeScript one is used.

Your config file has access to [underscore.js 1.4.4](http://underscorejs.org/).

Note: if your config file fails to load for some reason, all your key bindings are un-bound (as a precaution, presuming that your config file is in an unpredictable state). They will be re-bound again next time your config file is successfully loaded.

## Example Config

Put the following in `~/.windowsapp.coffee`

```coffeescript
# reload this config for testing
bind "R", ["cmd", "alt", "ctrl"], ->
  api.reloadConfig

# maximize window
bind "M", ["cmd", "alt", "ctrl"], ->
  win = api.focusedWindow
  frame = win.screen.frameWithoutDockOrMenu
  win.setFrame frame

# push to top half of screen
bind "K", ["cmd", "alt", "ctrl"], ->
  win = api.focusedWindow
  frame = win.screen.frameWithoutDockOrMenu
  frame.size.height /= 2
  win.setFrame frame

# push to bottom half of screen
bind "J", ["cmd", "alt", "ctrl"], ->
  win = api.focusedWindow
  frame = win.screen.frameWithoutDockOrMenu
  frame.origin.y += frame.size.height / 2
  frame.size.height /= 2
  win.setFrame frame
```

## More Configs

The [wiki home page](https://github.com/sdegutis/windowsapp/wiki) has a list of configs from users, and configs that replicate other apps (like SizeUp and Divvy).

## API

### Top Level

```coffeescript
- (API) api

- (void) alert(String str)                 # shows in a fancy alert
- (void) print(String str[, Float delay])  # shows in a plain old text box; optional delay is seconds

- (void) bind(String key,              # case-insensitive single-character string; see link below
              Array<String> modifiers, # may contain any number of: "cmd", "ctrl", "alt", "shift"
              Function fn)             # javascript fn that takes no args; return val is ignored
- (void) require(String path) # may be JS or CS file; looks at extension to know which
```

The function `bind()` uses [this list](https://github.com/sdegutis/windowsapp/blob/master/Windows/SDKeyBindingTranslator.m#L148) of key strings.

### Type: `API`

```coffeescript
- (void) reloadConfig

- (Settings) settings

- (Array<Window>) allWindows
- (Array<Window>) visibleWindows
- (Window) focusedWindow

- (Screen) mainScreen
- (Array<Screen>) allScreens
```

### Type: `Settings`

```coffeescript
property (Float) alertDisappearDelay # in seconds
property (Boolean) alertAnimates # when opening

- (NSBox) alertBox
- (NSTextField) alertTextField
```

### Type: `Window`

```coffeescript
- (CGRect) frame
- (void) setFrame(CGRect frame)

- (CGPoint) topLeft
- (void) setTopLeft(CGPoint thePoint)

- (CGSize) size
- (void) setSize(CGSize theSize)

- (void) maximize


- (Screen) screen
- (Array<Window>) otherWindowsOnSameScreen


- (String) title
- (Boolean) isWindowMinimized
- (Boolean) isAppHidden


- (Boolean) focusWindow

- (void) focusWindowLeft
- (void) focusWindowRight
- (void) focusWindowUp
- (void) focusWindowDown
```

### Type: `Screen`

```coffeescript
- (CGRect) frameIncludingDockAndMenu
- (CGRect) frameWithoutDockOrMenu

- (Screen) nextScreen
- (Screen) previousScreen
```

### Other Types

The rest of the types here are classes from ObjC, bridged to JS. Here's a few for reference:

```coffeescript
type CGRect

property (CGPoint) origin # top-left point on screen
property (CGSize) size


type CGSize

property (Float) width
property (Float) height


type CGPoint

property (Float) x
property (Float) y
```

The rest you'll have to look up for yourself.

## Todo

* Add option to auto-reload your config file when it changes
* Make config loader choose the config with the latest timestamp?
* Make "config loaded" alert show which config has been used
* Bug Kyle to make some nice JS helper functions for NSColor maybe?
* Make your top-level variables keep existing after config-reloads maybe?
* Maybe get Sparkle setup? But how would we auto-generate appcast.xml? Hmm...
* Figure out how to get it working on 10.6 (weak references aren't allowed there)
* Make it semi-safe to pass wrong stuff into API functions, especially `bind()`

## License

It's been said that a project's license reveals what the authors were afraid of. So if they're afraid of having their name dragged through the mud, they'll choose the BSD over MIT, and if they're afraid people will use their work in some proprietary project without contributing back to the community, they'll choose the GPL over either.
